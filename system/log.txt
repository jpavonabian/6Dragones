Ludum: You should make an elementalist class. A faeriekin class. A witchdoctor class. And lastly... a banshee class. (sooc)
Ludum: Banshee could be focused on acoustics/soundwave attacks/debuffs. faerekin and buffs/spritely magic type stuff. Elementalist on direct manipulation of the 4 prime elements. And witchdoctor on brewing/poultices, and spirit contact for aid. (sooc)
Ludum: There. Make it happen. You've got 20 minutes. (sooc)
Ludum: On what? (sooc)
Ludum: Will do. (sooc)
Ludum: hrm (say)
