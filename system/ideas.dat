IdeaDesc      The commands "junk" and "sacrifice" could be aliases for "trash", for ease of discovering how to get rid of useless items.
Another alternative could be a donation room, where you could leave items for newbies.

I think it would be interesting. Players could craft high level dragon gear, 
and Dragons could pay them high price for their work since dragons
lack the tradeskill abilities all together.

IdeaDesc      in addition to shroud spirit, could beast master gain the ability keen eyes. This would not only be fitting but it would allow them to see their pet while it is hidden from shroud spirit. currently while the shroud spirit is active you are unable to order your pet. it simply states their aren't here.
Also I'm not certain if I've idea submitted this before but being able to have some sort of first aid skill for our pets. perhaps two, possibly three levels of this, which can only be used on an animal companion.
basic first aid. = heals 1 die 10 damage per use. costs beast master movement points.
Advanced first aid. = heals 3 die 10 damage. costs beast master movement points.
Expert first aid. = heals 10 die 10 damage to animal, plus 1 to affection. costs the beast master movement points and some mana.
the costs associated with above skills could be based for basic and advanced. basic = 15 movement. advanced = 40 movement
Expert first aid would however cost the beast master 25 percent of their movement. This would be a fair trade off for such a large heal and a point of affection.

[4  ][Sha/Mag/Pri] Estella the Swordpupil
[58 ][Gold        ] Caelum Viator: Nomad of the Sky. [Duke of Forbidden City] [

--------------------------------=[  STAFF  ]=---------------------------------

We see this instead we see this:

--------------------------------=[ Players ]=---------------------------------
[  5][     Warrior] Zira the Swordpupil
[ 10][Beast Master] Krystothon the (null) [Throng] [Baron of Dakar City]

IdeaDesc      Currently if I understand the help file correctly, devour simply allows you to go longer periods of time without eating items designated as food. Being a dragon and consuming the entire body of our foes I think should logically sate hunger. I think think makes sense from a roleplay perspective and it also makes the game more enjoyable.
