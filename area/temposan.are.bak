&OThe vast wasteland reaches out into the distance. Sand and wind is all 
that can be seen at this point. Dunes reach in the air making the scenery 
pretty bland. Large dunes shift the sands through the winding wind. Sand 
blasts around causing the area to be quite unpleasant at most times from 
the shear force of it.
